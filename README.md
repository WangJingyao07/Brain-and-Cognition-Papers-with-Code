✨ **Papers, Code, Datasets for Neuroscience and Cognition Science**

This repository contains a reading list of papers with code on **Neuroscience and Cognition Science**. In addition, I will separately list papers from important conferences starting from 2023, e.g., NIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR etc. This repository is still being continuously improved. If you have found any relevant papers that need to be included in this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request (PR) or open an issue.
